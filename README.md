## Development server

Run `ng serve -o` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## PWA support

Run `ng build --prod` to build the project in production mode and
run `http-server -p 8083`, or any port number you like, to execute the app on a node server just to see the offline capabilities.

Go to your developer tools and switch to network tab. Go to service workers tab and checkbox the offline to see the offline features.
